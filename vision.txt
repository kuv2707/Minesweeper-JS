un objeto de boton que-
has a boolean variable indicating whether it has bomb or not
has a boolean variable indicating whether it is clicked or not
knows where it is on the grid so that it can communicate with its surrounding objects

Graphic states of the button:
unselected
    flagged
    unsure
selected
    <now cant be flagged or unsure>
    show number of bomb-buttons in contact with it


how the game works:
start me 8*8 grid of button objects
first click on any button reveals randomly chosen buttons
    the revealed buttons are contiguous 
as soon as revealed, randomly select places for the bombs and set those buttons 
state as "having bomb"
all the buttons should then show how many bomb-buttons they are in contact with
diagonally, horizontally, vertically.   those buttons which have bomb obv. dont need to show that

the first click never reveal bomb wala buttons, so bombs to be assigned after first click

a variable to keep track of whether the bomb-buttons are flagged or not
if that variable is equal to number of bomb-buttons, i.e., if all bomb buttons are flagged, 
the game ends and user wins
if bomb-button is selected, user loses

*DIFFICULT*
when a button shows number of bomb-buttons in contact with it, clicking on the button
should reveal few non-bomb buttons, ... how to do that, i mean, the amount and extent of revealed buttons
